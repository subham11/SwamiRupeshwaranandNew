# ============================================================
# DEPLOYMENT NOTE:
# Frontend deployment is handled automatically by AWS Amplify.

# auto-deploy when changes are pushed to the main branch.
#
# No AWS credentials or secrets are needed in GitHub.
# Amplify uses its own IAM role for deployments.
