# Note: For SSR to work correctly on Amplify Gen 2, ensure:
# 1. "output" in next.config.ts is NOT set to 'export'
# 2. Framework detection in Amplify Console is set to "Next.js SSR"
# 3. Redirects are configured in Amplify Console > App settings > Rewrites and redirects

# Add this redirect in Amplify Console:
# Source: /
# Target: /en  
# Type: 302 (Redirect - Temporary)
